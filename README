Mobile Grinnell

Mobile Grinnell is a quick and easy way to view the various postings from
Grinnell's website, including the Campus Memo, Campus News, Campus Events,
a campus map, building/office hours, the Dining Hall Menu, and the video 
of the month.

Mobile Grinnell is currently in ALPHA.  This means the application is
in development and not yet fully functional.  

Source for Grinnell-Menu-iOS can be obtained at the following location:
	https://github.com/GrinnellAppDev/Mobile-Grinnell-iOS

You can obtain the source with the following command:
	git clone git://github.com/GrinnellAppDev/Mobile-Grinnell-iOS.git
